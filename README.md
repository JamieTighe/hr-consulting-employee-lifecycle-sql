# HR Consulting – Employee Lifecycle Metrics (SQL)

SQL analysis project focused on employee lifecycle metrics (headcount, tenure, hiring and separations) to support HR reporting.

## What I did
- Built headcount and tenure metrics from employee records
- Analysed hiring and termination trends by year
- Joined organisational tables to identify concentration by business unit / region / leadership

## Key outputs
- Active headcount and average tenure
- Hires vs terminations over time (trend/spike identification)
- Top business units/regions by headcount and leadership-level termination counts

## Files
- `/sql` contains the queries, grouped by theme and numbered in logical order
